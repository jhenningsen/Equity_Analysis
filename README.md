- **Factor analysis:** Identifying and testing different factors (e.g., value, momentum, quality) that drive equity returns.
- **Time series analysis:** Applying statistical models (like ARIMA, GARCH) to stock price data to forecast volatility and returns.
- **Algorithmic trading strategies:** Backtesting and simulating trading strategies to evaluate their performance.

## Features

- **Modular Code:** Scripts are organized by function, making it easy to use specific components for your own research.
- **Data Handling:** Includes scripts for downloading, cleaning, and preprocessing financial data from various sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Quandl).
- **Visualization:** Tools for creating insightful charts and graphs to visualize market trends, portfolio performance, and other key metrics.
